# cryptanalysis

I am a software developer and student at Penn State studying statistics.  As a hobby, I have enjoyed reading about ciphers and encryption and am using this as a public repository of the algorithms and tools I build as I work my way through some textbooks learning the material in more detail.

I am *learning* cryptography, please understand this is hobby code made without any claim.  I welcome feedback.
